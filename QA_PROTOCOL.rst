==============================
 Renku Python QA Protocol
==============================

This document describes smoke tests for checking that a new ``renku-python``
release works with basic functionality.

Setup & general
---------------

- [ ] Check installation via pip.
- [ ] Check output of ``renku --version``.
- [ ] Check that integration tests run successfully.
- [ ] Look at the docs and make sure they're up to date.
- [ ] Check that ``--help`` is up to date for changed commands.

Test new repository
-------------------
- [ ] Init renku in a bare repo.
- [ ] Create a dataset and add a file.
- [ ] List datasets and files.
- [ ] Import a dataset from Zenodo and/or Dataverse.
- [ ] List datasets and files.
- [ ] Remove a dataset.
- [ ] Create a workflow process with at least two steps, which counts the
  words in a file and outputs the result into another file, utilizing
  `renku run`.
- [ ] Change the input file from the previous step and rerun the workflow
  to check the new results.
- [ ] Check that renku log looks sensible.
- [ ] Check that git log looks sensible.

Test existing repository
------------------------
- [ ] Enter an existing repository.
- [ ] Run ``renku migrate`` commands.
- [ ] List datasets and dataset files.
- [ ] Rerun an existing workflow.
- [ ] Check that renku log looks sensible.
- [ ] Check that git log looks sensible.
