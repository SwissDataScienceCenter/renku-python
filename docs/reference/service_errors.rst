Renku Core Service Errors
=========================

Here is a list of the possible service errors, including the reference code, the
user and developer messages, and a longer description of the error.

Errors are split in 3 big categories.


User generated errors
---------------------

*Error codes: from 1000 to 1999*

This category includes all the errors generated by user input. There is no unexpected
error nor bugs here. The user should be able to address these issues.
An example could be a wrong parameter (E.G. trying to access a non-existing repository,
or a private repository without proper permissions).
renku.core.models.entity


Programming errors
------------------

*Error codes: from 2000 to 2999*

The programming errors are bugs or unexpected cases. In the first case, they should lead
to creating a new GitHub issue; in the latter, it may be necessary to handle the specific
error to provide the user a precise explanation.


Intermittent errors
-------------------

*Error codes: from 3000 to 3999*

This category includes errors that may temporarily affect the user, but they don't depend
on a wrong input not can be classified as a bug. Repeating the same action after some
time should be enough to solve the problem.
An example could be a temporarily unavailable backend service (E.G. the GitLab instance)
or a transient network problem.
