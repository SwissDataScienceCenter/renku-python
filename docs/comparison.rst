How does this compare ...
=========================

There are many tools that can be used for doing your day-to-day work. Renku
is not **a silver bullet** or **a magic wand** for making your results
reproducible.

... to ``Makefile``
-------------------

If you are using ``Makefile`` to generate your :term:`outputs` you are on a
good path. However you might be missing versioning of your past executions.

Renku internally builds rules similar to those defined in a ``Makefile`` and 
makes sure that all files are saved before running a :term:`tool`.

Running the following ``renku run`` commands

.. code-block:: console

   $ renku run echo test > foo
   $ renku run wc -c < foo > foo.wc

is equivalent to this simple ``Makefile``.

.. code-block:: Makefile

   foo:
     @echo test > foo

   foo.wc: foo
     @wc -c < foo > foo.wc

Renku also makes sure that if any of the :term:`inputs` are modified only
the necessary "rules" are invoked. In addition, `make` does not run the rule if all
dependencies are older then the targets.

.. code-block:: console

   $ renku run echo second > foo
   $ renku status
   On branch master
   Files generated from newer inputs:
     (use "renku log [<file>...]" to see the full lineage)
     (use "renku update [<file>...]" to generate the file from its latest inputs)

          foo.wc: foo#deadbeef

   $ renku update foo.wc
   $ renku status
   On branch master
   All files were generated from the latest inputs.

.. note::

   As a **bonus** the ``Makefile`` can be generated by running
   ``renku log --format Makefile foo.wc`` command.
