A Python library for the `Renku collaborative data science platform
<https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku>`_. It allows the user to
create projects, manage datasets, and capture data provenance while performing
analysis tasks.

**NOTE**:
   ``renku-python`` is the python library for Renku that provides an SDK and a
   command-line interface (CLI). It *does not* start the Renku platform itself -
   for that, refer to the Renku docs on `running the platform
   <https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/setup.html>`_.

Installation
============

The latest release is available on PyPI and can be installed using
``pip``:

::

    $ pip install renku

The latest development versions are available on PyPI or from the Git
repository:

::

    $ pip install --dev renku
    # - OR -
    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python.git#egg=renku

Use following installation steps based on your operating system and preferences
if you would like to work with the command line interface and you do not need
the Python library to be importable.

Homebrew
--------

The recommended way of installing Renku on MacOS and Linux is via
`Homebrew <brew.sh>`_.

::

    $ brew tap swissdatasciencecenter/renku
    $ brew install renku

Isolated environments using ``pipx``
------------------------------------

Install and execute Renku in an isolated environment using ``pipx``.
It will guarantee that there are no version conflicts with dependencies
you are using for your work and research.

`Install pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx#install-pipx>`_
and make sure that the ``$PATH`` is correctly configured.

::

    $ python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    $ pipx ensurepath

Once ``pipx`` is installed use following command to install ``renku``.

::

    $ pipx install renku
    $ which renku
    ~/.local/bin/renku

Prevously we have recommended to use ``pipsi``. You can still use it or
`migrate to **pipx**
<https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx#migrating-to-pipx-from-pipsi>`_.

Docker
------

The containerized version of the CLI can be launched using Docker command.

::

    $ docker run -it -v "$PWD":"$PWD" -w="$PWD" renku/renku-python renku

It makes sure your current directory is mounted to the same place in the
container.

Usage
=====

Initialize a renku project:

::

    $ mkdir -p ~/temp/my-renku-project
    $ cd ~/temp/my-renku-project
    $ renku init

Create a dataset and add data to it:

::

    $ renku dataset create my-dataset
    $ renku dataset add my-dataset https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python/master/README.rst

Run an analysis:

::

    $ renku run wc < data/my-dataset/README.rst > wc_readme

Trace the data provenance:

::

    $ renku log wc_readme

These are the basics, but there is much more that Renku allows you to do with
your data analysis workflows. The full documentation will soon be available
at: https://renku-python.readthedocs.io/
