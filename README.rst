A Python library for the `Renga collaborative data science platform
<https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renga>`_. It allows the user to
create projects, manage datasets, and capture data provenance while performing
analysis tasks.


**NOTE**:
   ``renga-python`` is the python library for Renga that provides an SDK and a
   command-line interface (CLI). It *does not* start the Renga platform itself -
   for that, refer to the Renga docs on `running the platform
   <https://renga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/setup.html>`_.

**This is the development branch of `renga-python` and should be considered
highly volatile. The documentation for certain components may be out of
sync.**

Installation
------------

The latest release is available on PyPI and can be installed using
``pip``:

::

    $ pip install renga

The development branch can be installed directly from the Git repository:

::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renga-python.git@development#egg=renga


Usage
-----

Initialize a renga project:

::

    $ mkdir -p ~/temp/my-renga-project
    $ cd ~/temp/my-renga-project
    $ renga init

Create a dataset and add data to it:

::

    $ renga datasets create my-dataset
    $ renga datasets add my-dataset https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renga-python/development/README.rst

Run an analysis:

::

    $ renga run wc data/my-dataset/README.rst > wc_readme

Trace the data provenance:

::

    $ renga log wc_readme


These are the basics, but there is much more that renga allows you to do with
your data analysis workflows. The full documentation will soon be available
at: https://renga-python.readthedocs.io/en/development
