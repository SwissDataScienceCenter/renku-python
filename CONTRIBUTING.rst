official Renku docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `renku` for local development.

1. Fork the `SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/renku.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
   virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local
   development:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ mkvirtualenv renku
      $ cd renku/
      $ pip install -e .[all]

4. Create a branch for local development:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tests:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./run-tests.sh

   The tests will provide you with test coverage and also check PEP8
   (code style), PEP257 (documentation), flake8 as well as build the Sphinx
   documentation and run doctests.

   Before you submit a pull request, please reformat the code using black_.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ black .

   You may want to set up black_ styling as a `pre-commit hook to do this
   automatically <https://github.com/psf/black#version-control-integration>`_

   .. _black: https://github.com/psf/black/

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git add .
      $ git commit -s
          -m "component: title without verbs"
          -m "* NEW Adds your new feature."
          -m "* FIX Fixes an existing issue."
          -m "* BETTER Improves and existing feature."
          -m "* Changes something that should not be visible in release notes."
      $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

0. **Make sure you agree with the license and follow the [legal matter]
   (https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/documentation/wiki/Legal-matter).**
1. The pull request should include tests and must not decrease test coverage.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
