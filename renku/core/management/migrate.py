"""Renku migrations management.

Migrations files are put in renku/core/management/migrations directory. Name
of these files has m_1234__name.py format where 1234 is the migration version
and name can be any alphanumeric and underscore combination. Migration files
are sorted based on their lowercase name. Each migration file must define a
public "migrate" function that accepts a client as its argument.

When executing a migration, the migration file is imported as a module and the
"migrate" function is executed. Migration version is checked against the Renku
project version (in .renku/metadata.yml) and any migration which has a higher
version is applied to the project.
