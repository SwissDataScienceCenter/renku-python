"""Track provenance of data created by executing programs.

Capture command line execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tracking execution of your command line script is done by simply adding the
``renku run`` command before the actual command. This will enable detection of:

* arguments (flags),
* string and integer options,
* input files or directories if linked to existing paths in the repository,
* output files or directories if modified or created while running the command.

.. note:: If there were uncommitted changes in the repository, then the
   ``renku run`` command fails. See :program:`git status` for details.

.. warning:: Input and output paths can only be detected if they are passed as
   arguments to ``renku run``.

.. warning:: Circular dependencies are not supported for ``renku run``. See
   :ref:`circular-dependencies` for more details.

.. warning:: When using output redirection in ``renku run`` on Windows (with
   `` > file`` or `` 2> file``), all Renku errors and messages are redirected
   as well and ``renku run`` produces no output on the terminal. On Linux,
   this is detected by renku and only the output of the command to be run is
   actually redirected. Renku specific messages such as errors get printed to
   the terminal as usual and don't get redirected.

Detecting input paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any path passed as an argument to ``renku run``, which was not changed during
the execution, is identified as an input path. The identification only works if
the path associated with the argument matches an existing file or directory
in the repository.

The detection might not work as expected
if:

* a file is **modified** during the execution. In this case it will be stored
  as an **output**;
* a path is not passed as an argument to ``renku run``.

.. topic:: Specifying auxiliary inputs (``--input``)

   You can specify extra inputs to your program explicitly by using the
   ``--input`` option. This is useful for specifying hidden dependencies
   that don't appear on the command line. These input file must exist before
   execution of ``renku run`` command. This option is not a replacement for
   the arguments that are passed on the command line. Files or directories
   specified with this option will not be passed as input arguments to the
   script.

Detecting output paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any path **modified** or **created** during the execution will be added as an
output.

Because the output path detection is based on the Git repository state after
the execution of ``renku run`` command, it is good to have a basic
understanding of the underlying principles and limitations of tracking
files in Git.

Git tracks not only the paths in a repository, but also the content stored in
those paths. Therefore:

* a recreated file with the same content is not considered an output file,
  but instead is kept as an input;
* file moves are detected based on their content and can cause problems;
* directories cannot be empty.

.. note:: When in doubt whether the outputs will be detected, remove all
  outputs using ``git rm <path>`` followed by ``git commit`` before running
  the ``renku run`` command.

.. topic:: Command does not produce any files (``--no-output``)

   If the program does not produce any outputs, the execution ends with an
   error:

   .. code-block:: text

      Error: There are not any detected outputs in the repository.

   You can specify the ``--no-output`` option to force tracking of such
   an execution.

.. topic:: Specifying outputs explicitly (``--output``)

   You can specify expected outputs of your program explicitly by using the
   ``--output`` option. These output must exist after the execution of the
   ``renku run`` command. However, they do not need to be modified by
   the command.

.. cli-run-std

Detecting standard streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often the program expect inputs as a standard input stream. This is detected
and recorded in the tool specification when invoked by ``renku run cat < A``.

Similarly, both redirects to standard output and standard error output can be
done when invoking a command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ renku run grep "test" B > C 2> D

.. warning:: Detecting inputs and outputs from pipes ``|`` is not supported.

Specifying inputs and outputs programmatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the list of inputs and outputs are not known before execution of the
program. For example, a program might accept a date range as input and access
all files within that range during its execution.

To address this issue, the program can dump a list of input and output files
that it is accessing in ``inputs.txt`` and ``outputs.txt``. Each line in these
files is expected to be the path to an input or output file within the
project's directory. When the program is finished, Renku will look for
existence of these two files and adds their content to the list of explicit
inputs and outputs. Renku will then delete these two files.

By default, Renku looks for these two files in ``.renku/tmp`` directory. One
can change this default location by setting ``RENKU_FILELIST_PATH``
environment variable. When set, it points to the directory within the
project's directory where ``inputs.txt`` and ``outputs.txt`` reside.

Exit codes
~~~~~~~~~~

All Unix commands return a number between 0 and 255 which is called
"exit code". In case other numbers are returned, they are treaded module 256
(-10 is equivalent to 246, 257 is equivalent to 1). The exit-code 0 represents
a *success* and non-zero exit-code indicates a *failure*.

Therefore the command specified after ``renku run`` is expected to return
exit-code 0. If the command returns different exit code, you can specify them
with ``--success-code=<INT>`` parameter.

.. code-block:: console

   $ renku run --success-code=1 --no-output fail

.. _circular-dependencies:

Circular Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circular dependencies are not supported in ``renku run``. This means you cannot
use the same file or directory as both an input and an output in the same step,
for instance reading from a file as input and then appending to it is not
allowed. Since renku records all steps of an analysis workflow in a dependency
graph and it allows you to update outputs when an input changes, this would
lead to problems with circular dependencies. An update command would change the
input again, leading to renku seeing it as a changed input, which would run
update again, and so on, without ever stopping.

Due to this, the renku depedency graph has to be *acyclic*. So instead of
appending to an input file or writing an output file to the same directory
that was used as an input directory, create new files or write to other
directories, respectively.
