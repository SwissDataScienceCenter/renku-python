"""Rollback project to a previous point in time.

If you want to undo actions taken using Renku in a project, you can use the
``renku rollback`` command to do so.
This command shows a list of all actions done by renku and lets you pick
one that you want to return to, discarding any changes done in the repo (by
Renku or manually) after that point. Once you pick a checkpoint to return to,
the commands shows all files and Renku objects that would be affected by the
rollback and how they would be affected. If you confirm, the project will be
reset to that point in time, with anything done after that point being
deleted/lost.

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku rollback
    Select a checkpoint to roll back to:

    [0] 2021-10-20 09:50:04         renku workflow edit cp-blabla-asdasf-0b535 --name test
    [1] 2021-10-20 09:49:19         renku rerun asdasf
    [2] 2021-10-20 09:48:59         renku run cp blabla asdasf
    [3] 2021-10-20 08:37:00         renku dataset add e blabla
    [4] 2021-10-20 08:31:16         renku dataset create m
