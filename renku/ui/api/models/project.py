r"""Renku API Project.

Project class acts as a context for other Renku entities like Dataset, or
Inputs/Outputs. It provides access to internals of a Renku project for such
entities.

Normally, you do not need to create an instance of Project class directly
unless you want to have access to Project metadata (e.g. path) or get its status. To separate
parts of your script that uses Renku entities, you can create a Project context
manager and interact with Renku inside it:

.. code-block:: python

    from renku.api import Project, Input

    with Project():
        input_1 = Input("input_1", "path_1")

You can use Project's ``status`` method to get info about outdated outputs and
activities, and modified or deleted inputs:

.. code-block:: python

    from renku.api import Project

    outdated_generations, outdated_activities, modified_inputs, deleted_inputs = Project().status()
